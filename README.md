# Brain_tumor_segmentation

## Project Overview
**BRISC2025_segmentation** is a Python-based project focused on segmentation tasks, with a particular emphasis on medical image segmentation. The repository is designed to provide tools, models, and workflows for segmenting brain tumors from MRI scansâ€”a critical task in medical image analysis that aids in diagnosis, treatment planning, and research.

## Key Features

- **Medical Image Segmentation:** Implements state-of-the-art techniques to delineate brain tumors and other regions of interest from MRI images.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes popular architectures such as U-Net and its variants, optimized for accurate pixel-wise classification.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** Includes data preprocessing, model training, inference, and postprocessing steps to ensure robust and reproducible results.
- **Research-Oriented:** Provides a foundation for experimentation, evaluation, and further development in the field of medical image analysis.
